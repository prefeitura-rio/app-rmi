Whenever the user asks you to do the "commit thing", you must:
- Check whether there's a justfile, Makefile or something similar so you know how commands should run
- Format the code using a proper tool for the programming language
- Check for linting and building issues
- See the diff for all staged files (do not add other files)
- Prepare a meaningful commit message, following conventional commits convention
- Commit it!

You should never do the commit thing without explicit consent from the user.
